nexusDescription="[quote]﻿Yes Beloved, I [i]do[/i] see that Trapper!\n<br />   ﻿- You, after accidentally obliterating a poxwalker instead[/quote]\n<br />This mod alters the targeting of Brain Burst.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Per-enemy selection, with extra toggles by group for quick bulk-selection (Boss/Elite/Special/Fodder)\n<br />[*]Filter application for primary fire, secondary fire, or both\n<br />[*]Optional setting to use different filters for each attack type\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known quirks:\n<br />[/b]Because this mod prevents you from attacking targets unless you have given permission to do so, the game will not register any inputs when holding the primary attack button unless you are looking at a \"valid\" target. This means that the normal \"waiting for target\" animation that occurs while holding primary fire [i]will not play[/i] while this mod is enabled. This is a side effect of intercepting input and is normal.\n<br />\n<br />This mod will sometimes still allow initial targeting of undesired enemies, though this is rare - when this happens, the mod will automatically disengage as soon as it has registered an incorrect lock. You can continue to hold your attack input and it will attempt to lock onto the proper target as soon as possible.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Additional Credits:[/b]\n<br />Shoutout to Moorus for the mod concept, and ItsAlxl + Wobin for their help during its creation.\n<br />Thank you to SyuanTsai for providing Traditional Chinese [zh-tw] localization, and to jcyl2023 for providing Simplified Chinese [zh-cn] localization."
