nexusDescription="Adds an indicator showing your current critical strike chance. It is updated in real time and takes your perks and blessings into account.\n<br />\n<br />[b]This modification is highly customizable and lets you personalize:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The indicator's vertical and horizontal position\n<br />[*]The indicator's colour and opacity (RGB)\n<br />[*]The percentage's accuracy with optional two decimal places precision\n<br />[*]The percentage's appearance with one of 5 neat icons\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Important Notes:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Some weapons, like the Revolvers, have a unique Critcal Bonus stat. This bonus is applied to the weapon the moment the shoot action is made and is erased the moment a different action is made, like ADSing.\n<br />[*]Guaranteed crits (such as Zealot's Dash) do not count towards the game's crit chance calculation and are instead applied as buffs. This means every source of guaranteed crits needs to be checked manually. Let me know if I missed any buffs that give you 100% crit chance.\n<br />[*]Russian localization by xsSplater\n<br />[*]Chinese localization by deluxghost\n<br />\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Known issues:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The game itself has faulty crit chance calculation, like giving additional 0.2% chance after a Crucian Roullete shot or updating the revolver's chance only after the shoot action is made.\n<br />[/list]"
