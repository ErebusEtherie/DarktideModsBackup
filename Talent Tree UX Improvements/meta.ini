nexusDescription="In vanilla Darktide, you are not allowed to refund a talent if you have subsequent nodes that depend on it. With this mod, refunding a talent will also refund all of the talents that depend on it, making it easier to switch around your talents in the middle of the talent tree. Additionally, you can swap exclusive talents by double-clicking and the mod will try to preserve as much as possible below those talents. If you have 0 talent points remaining, the mod will allow you to swap siblings as long as the swap would result in a valid tree. See images for examples of each action.\n<br />\n<br />Each of those two actions can be configured to either be disabled, activate on single-click, or activate on double-click.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Make sure that your new connections will still be valid before you swap exclusive talents! [/b]If the rest of your tree is not connected to the talent that you're swapping to, it'll reset everything below that point. So please save yourself some headache and make sure that your connections will work before swapping exclusive talents.\n<br />\n<br />Please note that your game may briefly hitch when swapping exclusive talents, particularly near the top of the tree. That's because the mod is removing all talents below it, then trying to re-equip them all.\n<br />\n<br />Simplified Chinese localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/127776653]deluxghost[/url]\n<br />Russian localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2593497]xsSplater[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://ko-fi.com/itsalxl][img]https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Source: [url=https://github.com/ItsAlxl/darktide-mods/tree/main/TalentRefundBelow]GitHub[/url]"
