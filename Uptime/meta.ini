nexusDescription="[size=6]Uptime\n<br />[/size]This mod measures how long your buffs are active during combat, and how many stacks you have. \n<br />It's a great tool to see if your talents &amp; blessings are worth it, or if you want to switch up your build.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][size=4]Press F8 [/size]on the Mourningstar to open Uptime[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]How is uptime calculated? \n<br />[/size]It's the time a buff is active (any number of stacks) [b]during combat [/b](combat begins when you attack/get attacked, and ends if you haven't attacked/been attacked for 5 seconds).\n<br />The average stacks and duration at max stacks is relative to your buff uptime. \n<br />E.g. if during a 10 minute combat your buff is active for 2 minutes, it has 20% uptime. If you're at maximum stacks for 1 of those 2 minutes, you have 50% max stacks time.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]This mod also fixes the bug where Darktide wouldn't always show all yours buffs in the HUD![/size]"
