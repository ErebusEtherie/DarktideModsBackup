nexusDescription="This mod contains options to remove certain decorations from loading screens. [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/462]Custom Loading Background[/url] lets you add beautiful art to your loading screens (or horrifying images if that floats your boat), but I got annoyed by the random decorations of the loading screen covering up my wallpapers. Therefore, I have sentenced them to death I can bask in the glory of my wallpapers, which I've spent way too much time obsessing over... \n<br />\n<br />Each loading screen contains the following elements:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Hint text\n<br />[*]Skull line divider\n<br />[*]Prompt for next hint text\n<br />[*]Spinning skull icon (Also disables skull during mission loading! Not disabled by default)\n<br />[*]Loading reason/status (not affected by this mod; use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/436]Remove Loading Status[/url] [RLS] or [b][url=http://https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/438]LessAnnoyingLoading[/url]﻿[/b])\n<br />[*]Background image (not affected by this mod)\n<br />[*]Fade to black transitional overlay (not affected by this mod)\n<br />[/list]Of the affected elements, you can toggle which ones you want to hide in the Mod Options menu. Note that changes will not apply until the next game restart/reload. Reloading may cause other mods to function improperly, so I'd recommend simply restarting the game.\n<br />By default, I left the spinning skull on, since it makes it pretty obvious if the game has frozen. I also don't mind it covering up the mission loading screen, even though you can tell the game didn't freeze by the characters shuffling in their seats.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Installation[/size]\n<br />Same as any other mod; see this [url=https://dmf-docs.darkti.de/#/installing-mods]guide for manual installation[/url] if you're confused. \n<br />\n<br />Load order doesn't matter.\n<br />\n<br />The function to remove the spinning skull replaces the original function, so if any other mod tries to replace it there will be issues. Report that if you find it.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]FAQ[/size]\n<br />[b]What are those loading backgrounds?[/b]\n<br />I'm using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/462]Custom Loading Background[/url] with [url=https://github.com/Backup158/DarktideCustomLoadingBackgroundsList]my curated list[/url]. The main list is one of the curated lists enabled by default, but my repository has some additional lists you can tack on.\n<br />[b]What the fuck is up with that text? Die dogfucker!\n<br />[/b]That's from an edited version of RLS. By default, it will make the text blank. Without it (and without LessAnnoyingLoading), the loading status message will still be there.\n<br />[b]If you already made RLS, why not just add this as an update to it?[/b]\n<br />Removing all loading status messages (such as the ones at the Commodore's Vestures) and removing elements from just loading screens are two different purposes, so I keep them in two separate mods to avoid scope creep. Even though there's some overlap, combining them just makes it harder to search for through Nexus, and it's not like installing an additional mod is difficult. \n<br />Plus, the way RLS is made not only lets you hide the text, but also lets you replace the text with whatever you want (although technically I made it trivial to replace the text for the hint prompt in this too).\n<br />[b]Why do the setting changes need a restart to apply?\n<br />[/b]Honestly I don't know lol. Even when I was directly checking the settings every time a load screen appeared, it still wouldn't apply the changes if you unhid an element beforehand. If I had to guess, I'd say the load screen's textures/text settings get cached after initialization so the functions I'm hooking don't actually get called again. Well actually that probably isn't true because I could trigger rehook errors. Huh, yeah that's a thing. Wait should I really be leaving all of this in the faq? Ah whatever, it's not like anyone reads the description anyways.\n<br />[b]Hey! You didn't answer my question! Why do you fuck dogs????[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]I found a bug!\n<br />[/b]Cool! Wait, I mean bad! Send me a [url=https://dmf-docs.darkti.de/#/faqs?id=how-do-i-report-mod-errors]game log[/url] in the posts/bugs tab and describe what you were doing + how often it happens, and I'll do my best to fix it. I'd prefer if you send it here rather than Discord because it's easier for other people to reference it."
