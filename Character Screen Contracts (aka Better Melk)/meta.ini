nexusDescription="Displays your current contract progress for each character in the character selection menu.\n<br />\n<br />Most of this mod's original functionality has been officially implemented by Fatshark, so that obsolete functionality has been removed from the mod. Here is the original description for historical purposes:\n<br />[spoiler]Normally, Sire Melk doesn't actually start to track your contract progress until you talk to him first every week. He similarly holds the weekly completion bonus hostage until you talk to him.\n<br />\n<br />With BetterMelk, you don't have to talk to him for either of these: you will automatically accept new contracts and automatically collect the weekly completion bonus. You can also enable messages to notify you when you have new* contracts (disabled by default) or when you've finished all your contracts (enabled by default).\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, your current weekly contract progress for each character is displayed in the character select screen.\n<br />\n<br />* Note that for the purposes of this notification, the mod assumes your contracts are new if you just loaded into the hub and all your contracts have zero progress on them. So if you, for example, repeatedly quit to character select and re-enter the hub, you'll be told you have new contracts even though you don't really.[/spoiler]\n<br />If you want to make Sire Melk more enjoyable to talk to, consider downloading my other mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/59]Friendly Vendors[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://ko-fi.com/itsalxl][img]https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Simplified Chinese localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/127776653]deluxghost[/url]\n<br />Russian localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2593497]xsSplater[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />Source: [url=https://github.com/ItsAlxl/DarktideMods/tree/main/BetterMelk]GitHub[/url]"
