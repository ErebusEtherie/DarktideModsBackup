nexusDescription="[size=4][left][color=#d9d2e9]Allows the tracking of the spawn and deaths of specific enemies (specials and monsters) through notifications, as well the number of such units currently alive through a HUD element (\"overlay\")[/color][/left]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=4]   ﻿→ Please use [/size][size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/10]Custom HUD[/url]﻿ to reposition the HUD element![/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod was made to be as thoroughly customizable as possible, and the vast majority of features can be simply turned off if so desired. That being said, if it is a bit \"too much\" and you're not looking for as much in-game information as this mod provides, I highly recommend checking out [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/194]Spawn Feed[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />If you'd like a quick showcase of what this mod does, here is a short video; otherwise, [u]the full features are detailed below[/u].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]eetS5gZIoik[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]1. Tracking of units through notifications[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Displays a notification when a unit (special/monster) spawns or dies. Notification tracking can be toggled on/off for each trackable unit.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Identical notifications are automatically collapsed together [i](e.g. \"Sniper died\" + \"Sniped died\" in a quick succession will only display one notif saying \"Sniper died x2\")[/i].\n<br />[*]Spawn/death notifs for a same unit type can be collapsed into one \"hybrid\" notif [i](e.g. \"Sniper died\" + \"Sniper spawned x2\" can become \"Sniper - Spawned x2 - Died x1)[/i]. This can be toggled on/off globally.\n<br />[*]The background color of notifs can be changed separately for spawn/death/hybrid notifs, and notifs can have a \"text\" style [i](e.g. \"Sniper died x2\")[/i] or an \"icon\" style [i](e.g. \"Sniper x2 [Swords icon]\")[/i]. (Chosen globally, i.e. for all unit types at once)\n<br />[*]The notif entry sound can be changed for enemy spawns/deaths. When a notification is refreshed (or transformed into a hybrid one) because of a new spawn/death, its duration is refreshed, and the corresponding sound played again.\n<br />[*]Each tracked unit has a [b]priority level[/b], from 1 to 3, which can be set up for each unit, with 3 being the least important and 1 the most important (except monsters, which have a set priority level of 0). Each priority level is assigned a color, which will be the color of the unit's name in their notifications. This color can be changed for each priority level.\n<br />[/list][size=5]\n<br />2. Tracking of units through the HUD element[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Displays a permanent HUD element (\"overlay\") that shows and updates the number of currently alive units of each type.[/size][size=4] Each unit type can be shown in the overlay all the time, never, or only when one or more of those units are active.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />- Units displayed in the overlay are ordered, with the lowest priority level units at the top. Units of different priority levels are separated by a small gap in the overlay's list.\n<br />- Unit types which currently have no active unit are greyed out [i](if they are set up to appear when none are active)[/i]. Unit types which have at least one active unit can be either a default, constant color (white), or mirror the priority level's notif name color. This can be toggled on/off for each priority level.\n<br />- The overlay's size and font can be changed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n<br />\n<br />I am [i]very[/i] new to modding (in fact, this is my first mod ever!), which means I might not be as quick to release updates / bugfixes as many others are. So I'm sorry in advance if that ever becomes an issue, and I'll try my best to avoid that. ^_^\n<br />\n<br />If you're encountering a bug, please submit a bug report with as much information as possible, and I'll take a look.\n<br />If you have a suggestion/question, please let me know in the mod page's comments, or if you prefer on Discord (@Vatinas).\n<br />\n<br />Many thanks to everyone on the Darktide Modders Discord, especially Fracticality, OvenProofMars, and ItsAlxl, who were so very patient with me and helped me [i]tremendously[/i]!\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]\n<br />[color=#f4cccc]Now go! Those heretics won't purge themselves, will they?[/color][/size]"
