nexusDescription="I made this mod as this [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/631]mod[/url] I made is very complicated, and some people probably don't want some of its features. All this does is you pick a color for a slot in mod settings, then the mod has my color allocator which prevents duplicates. This mod only colors where slot is effect in the base game and any mods that request that slot and color. A more simple and reliable mod for those who just want their colors changed from the base game!\n<br />\n<br />Please let me know any issues!\n<br />Thanks,\n<br />Maddy"
