nexusDescription="[b]AudioReplacer by ClaytorYurnero[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b] -- This mod is an edited version of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/223]Danktide (EnemyAudioReplacer) by Jortune1[/url][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[i]This mod is seemingly abandoned, so I'm posting the version I've personally modified for increased functionality.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[u]I am open to suggestions for more audio replacements.[/u]\n<br />\n<br />Very WIP, need to add more hooks to sounds in the future.\n<br />Check requirements! You need to refresh mods by using CTRL + SHIFT + R after changing options.\n<br />Need to have developer mode and console enabled, as described in Audio Plugin mod\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Known issues:[/u][/b] \n<br />\n<br />Small stutters when playing some sounds, probably because it's reading files directly (Ensure game is on SSD)\n<br />\n<br />Weapon audio replacements may sometimes play at maximum volume when used by other players.\n<br />\n<br />How to install:\n<br />1: Install requirements\n<br />2: Move AudioReplacer to your mods folder\n<br />3: Add AudioReplacer to mod_load_order\n<br />4: In mod options, check which sounds you want changed.\n<br />5: Overwrite the files in AudioReplacer&#92;audio with whatever sounds you want, .opus is recommended file format but mp3 works too. Right now you need to have the same names as the names in the existing folders."
