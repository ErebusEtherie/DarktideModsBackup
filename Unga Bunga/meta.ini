nexusDescription="[b]UngaBunga has been replaced by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/510]Skitarius[/url].[/b]\n<br />Skitarius does everything UngaBunga (and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/88]KeepSwinging[/url]﻿) is capable of, but offers additional features, including fully customizable combo sequences. It also offers additional ranged weapon settings, serving as a replacement to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/87]FullAuto[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />UngaBunga will still receive some bugfixes and remain available for download, but further work will take place in Skitarius.\n<br />\n<br />Please note that at this time Skitarius is [b]NOT compatible[/b] with UngaBunga - it is a full replacement. You should disable UngaBunga while Skitarius is in use. Other mods do not conflict with Skitarius.\n<br />\n<br />[center]﻿[img]https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png[/img]﻿[/center]\n<br />This mod automatically releases heavy attacks as soon as they are available. This means that when the primary attack input is held, the game will continuously chain heavy attacks, with each one being charged for the minimum possible duration.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Can spam either by holding the primary attack input, or holding a custom keybind\n<br />[*]Does not interfere with normal light/special/push/block actions\n<br />[*]Works on all melee weapons, with optional per-weapon configuration\n<br />[*]Properly handles mixed timings and heavy combo chains\n<br />[*]Properly handles differences in attack speed (i.e. from class differences, talent nodes, buffs, stimms, etc.)\n<br />[*]Optional extra settings to tweak heavy attack behavior, detailed below\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Usage:[/b]\n<br />By default, you only need to hold your primary attack input; the mod will handle the rest.\n<br />If you set a custom keybind, that key will need to be held to spam heavy attacks rather than the primary attack input.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Keybinds:\n<br />[/b][i]Mod Toggle[/i]\n<br />This setting is a keybind - pressing this keybind will disable the mod if it is on, or enable the mod if it is off.\n<br />The \"Notify on Toggle\" will (if enabled) display the current status of the mod (enabled/disabled) each time you toggle.\n<br />[i]\n<br />[/i][i]Mod Toggle (Held)[/i]\n<br />This setting is identical to [i]Mod Toggle[/i], but it will revert to its previous setting when released. For example, if the mod is currently enabled, holding this keybind will disable the mod, and releasing will re-enable the mod. The \"Notify On Toggle\" setting does not apply to this setting.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Cancel Toggle[/i]\n<br />This setting is a keybind - pressing this keybind will disable block/special-cancelling if it is enabled, or enable block/special-cancelling if it is disabled.\n<br />The mod will use weapon-specific block/special-cancel settings to determine this keybind's behavior if the equipped weapon has its \"Weapon Override\" setting enabled. Otherwise, it will use the Global block/special-cancel settings.\n<br />The \"Notify on Toggle\" setting will (if enabled) display the current status of block/special-cancelling (enabled/disabled) each time you toggle.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Cancel Toggle (Held)[/i]\n<br />This setting is identical to [i]Cancel Toggle[/i], but it will revert to its previous setting when released. For example, if the mod is currently set to block/special-cancel, holding this keybind will allow standard uncancelled heavy chains, and releasing will re-enable block/special-cancelling. The \"Notify On Toggle\" setting does not apply to this setting.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Settings:[/b]\n<br />[i]Cancel[/i]\n<br />This setting is a toggle, and defaults to Off.\n<br />When enabled, the mod will automatically block/special-cancel after a completed heavy attack. This results in spamming the first heavy attack in the weapon's combo chain. Note that some weapons are inherently slower to block/special-cancel than others, and this timing is not something the mod can adjust.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Cancel Mode[/i]\n<br />This setting is a dropdown, and offers two choices: \"Block\", and \"Special\". The default is \"Block\".\n<br />When [i]Cancel [/i]is enabled, or a [i]Cancel Toggle[/i] keybind is pressed/held, this setting will determine the type of attack cancel that is performed.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Thrust Stacks[/i]\n<br />This setting can be given a value 0-3. The default is 0.\n<br />When set to 0, the mod will release heavy attacks as soon as they are available, giving you the fastest heavy attack spam.\n<br />When set to 1-3, the mod will instead release heavy attacks once that number of Thrust stacks are reached. \n<br />If the weapon you are currently using does not have Thrust applied to it, this setting is ignored, regardless of its value.\n<br />This setting also applies to the \"Slow and Steady\" blessing.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Thrust Stacks (Special Attacks)[/i]\n<br />This setting has a toggle, and a slider with values from 0-3. The defaults are Off and 0, respectively.\n<br />When the toggle is enabled, this feature functions identically to the [i]Thrust Stacks[/i] setting, but only applies when a weapon's special state is entered (e.g. Charged Thunder Hammers, Revved Chainaxes, Flipped Shovels, etc.). \n<br />When a heavy attack is triggered in this state, the [i]Thrust Stacks[/i] setting will be ignored in favor of this setting.\n<br />Note that this only affects special attacks which can be charged as heavy attacks, and only when the Thrust/Slow and Steady blessing is present.\n<br />When disabled, the [i]Thrust Stacks[/i] setting will be used for these attacks.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Individual Weapon Settings[/i]\n<br />For each weapon, you can set any of the above settings as an individual override. These will apply only when the selected weapon is equipped, and only when that weapon has its \"Weapon Enabled\" setting set to \"On\". If \"Weapon Enabled\" is set to \"Off\", the global settings will be used instead.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Reset Settings[/i]\n<br />This is visually a \"toggle\", but it functions like a button. If you click it, ALL of your individual weapon settings will be cleared. Global settings are unaffected.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]If you are looking for a mod to spam light attacks, you should install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/88]KeepSwinging[/url].[/b] This mod does NOT touch light attacks and will not spam them for you.\n<br />If you already have KeepSwinging installed, this mod will not interfere with its operation, and KeepSwinging will not interfere with this mod by default. \n<br />However, KeepSwinging's Modifier Mode [i]will[/i] override this mod's behavior if you have that setting enabled.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues:[/b]\n<br />This mod will sometimes lose track of the player's weapon, causing it to stop functioning. This typically only happens if the player has been disabled or killed, or otherwise loses access to their weapon. In most circumstances, the mod will recover automatically and resume working without any player intervention. If it does not, it can be forcibly \"reset\" by swapping away from, then back to your melee weapon. Additional methods to prevent this issue are being worked on.\n<br />\n<br />Force Swords Mk II (Obscurus) and Mk IV (Deimos) do not trigger more than one heavy after a special is initiated but not consumed, if special-cancelling is enabled. This is because after the first one it will wait until the special activation wears off, because these specials cannot be refreshed. I may tweak this behavior in the future (i.e. to have it chain heavies as normal until the special is consumed or expires), depending on how the current functionality is received.\n<br />\n<br />The Grenadier Gauntlet will properly charge its first heavy attack, but will not chain inputs. This is the normal behavior of this weapon, and is not caused by this mod. Additionally, the Grenadier Gauntlet is incompatible with most mod settings, and so does not have per-weapon configuration.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Additional Special-Cancelling Information:\n<br />[/b]When special-cancelling, the Catachan \"Devil's Claw\" Swords will only maintain the parry animation for the duration of the \"perfect parry\" window, after which heavy attacks will resume. The parry window in total is quite long, but it can be interrupted at any time - maintaining it for only the \"perfect parry\" duration gives the best benefits of the parry action while keeping attack chains fast.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b]Some weapons cannot special-cancel, and will as a result ignore the [i]Cancel[/i] setting if [i]Cancel Mode[/i] is set to \"Special\" while they are equipped.\n<br />These weapons are:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Orox Mk II &amp; Mk III Battle Maul &amp; Slab Shield\n<br />[*]Chainaxes (All Marks)\n<br />[*]Chainswords (All Marks)\n<br />[*]Eviscerators (All Marks)\n<br />[*]Relic Blades (All Marks)\n<br />[*]Sapper Shovels (Munitorum Mk III and Munitorum Mk VII)\n<br />[*]Latrine Shovels (Brute-Brainer Mk V and Brute-Brainer Mk XIX)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The Battle Maul &amp; Slab Shield cannot special-cancel due to its unique special rooting the user and being a held action.\n<br />Chain weapons, Relic Blades, and Folding Shovels cannot special-cancel due to their specials being toggles.\n<br />\n<br />There are two theoretical ways to handle toggled specials:\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Only special-cancel when the current state is OFF\n<br />[*]Special-cancel as normal, toggling the state with each swing\n<br />[/list]Option 1 is admittedly useful, but isn't a proper cancellation (i.e. it does not cancel after every swing to reset heavy chains) and requires its own special handling, so I have not implemented it.\n<br />Option 2 is more of a detriment than a benefit, so I have not implemented it either.\n<br />There aren't any plans to enable special-cancelling for weapons that currently lack it; please do not request otherwise unless you have a good justification.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Additional Credits:\n<br />[/b]Thank you to SyuanTsai for providing Traditional Chinese [zh-tw] localization!"
