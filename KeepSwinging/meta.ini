nexusDescription="[b]Requires Darktide Mod Framework version 23.10.04 or later.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Spare your joints - use keybinds to spam light melee attacks for you. You can set a toggle keybind and a held keybind. If you want to pepper in some heavy attacks amidst the light attack spam, you can simply hold down your normal attack button. Alternatively, enable 'Modifier Mode,' meaning the auto-swing won't perform light attacks for you, but will instead modify your normal attack button to spam light attacks instead of performing heavy attacks. There is also an option to use melee special attacks, including those on ranged weapons, e.g. bashes and bayonets.\n<br />\n<br />A HUD indicator will let you know if auto-swinging is currently enabled. This indicator can be moved using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/10]Custom HUD by Fracticality[/url].\n<br />\n<br />This mod works by basically spamming click for you, but in a way that should be more reliable and precise than a macro. It does not actually alter any gameplay or weapon behavior. Rest assured that this mod falls squarely within Fatshark's modding policy, so you don't have to worry about it being flagged as cheating.\n<br />\n<br />Also comes in \"ranged\" flavor - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/87]FullAuto[/url] (by me). If you encounter issues with this mod or FullAuto, I recommend switching to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/510]Skitarius by Norkkom[/url]. That mod includes a \"quick start\" guide to recreate the functionality of these mods, as well as a lot more configurability on top of that.\n<br />\n<br />Simplified Chinese localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/127776653]deluxghost[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://ko-fi.com/itsalxl][img]https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Source: [url=https://github.com/ItsAlxl/DarktideMods/tree/main/KeepSwinging]GitHub[/url]"
