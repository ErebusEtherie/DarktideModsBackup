nexusDescription="[b]StickyFingers[/b] is a mod that makes interactions \"stick\" - when holding the Interact input, the mod will automatically initiate and maintain interactions as soon as you are allowed. This means you will automatically pick up items, revive/rescue teammates, remove nets, place servo-skulls, etc., as long as the Interact input is held. No more spamming the button!\n<br />\n<br />This mod also has optional settings to [i]always [/i]interact with these things, regardless of whether you are pressing anything.\n<br />Because the mod will override player inputs to force interactions when these settings are enabled, the mod is set up to disengage via dodging from automatic interactions if the jump/dodge input is pressed.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Settings:[/b]\n<br />[i]Auto-Interact[/i]: When enabled, the mod will automatically interact with any options you have set in the section below.\n<br />The mod will also automatically collect Tainted Skulls when [i]Auto-Interact[/i] is enabled, even if all [i]Auto-Interact[/i] options listed below are disabled.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Multi-Option Interactibles:[/i] Automatically selects the chosen interaction option for items that have multiple options (e.g. Stolen Rations)\n<br />[i]Medicae Stations[/i]: Automatically uses Medicae Stations when in range, if allowed by the [i]Maximum Health[/i] setting.\n<br />[i]   ﻿Maximum Health[/i]: The mod will only automatically use Medicae Stations when [u]at or below[/u] this health percentage.\n<br />[i]Teammate Actions[/i]: Automatically assists teammates from any of the following situations, provided the respective toggle is enabled:\n<br />[i]   ﻿[/i]Available Toggles: [i]Downed Teammates[/i] / [i]Hogtied Teammates[/i] / [i]Ledge-hanging Teammates[/i] / [i]Netted Teammates[/i]\n<br />[i]Mission Interactions[/i]: Automatically interacts with any actions required to progress the mission. \n<br />   ﻿This includes planting charges/skulls, pressing switches/levers, activating airlocks/elevators, etc.\n<br />[i]Doors[/i]: Automatically opens/closes doors, based on the [i]Allowed Door Actions[/i] setting. Only applies to the standard toggle-able doors.\n<br />[i]   ﻿Allowed Door Actions[/i]: Doors will only be interacted with if the available interaction matches this setting. Options: [i]Open[/i] / [i]Close[/i] / [i]Open and Close[/i]\n<br />[i]Hacking Minigames[/i]: Automatically enters hacking minigames when they are available.\n<br />[i]Luggables[/i]: Automatically picks up and deposits Power Cells, Vacuum Capsules, and Cryonic Rods.\n<br />\n<br />[b]NOTE:[/b] This mod will vacuum up any ammo and resources while holding the Interact button, but it will [i]not [/i]collect them through the Auto-Interact settings. If you want to do that, you should use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/375]Auto Loot[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Known Issues:\n<br />[/b]The scanning servo-skull deployment (e.g. on the bridge of [i]Vigil Station Oblivium[/i]) has issues with auto-interact and requires manual input to complete. This is being looked into.\n<br />\n<br />Chinese localization provided by jcyl2023."
