nexusDescription="The mod allow you to change the colour and priority of several outlines:\n<br />- Tagged enemies\n<br />- Enemies highlighted by the veteran's executioner's stance\n<br />- Enemies tagged by a veteran with the focus target keystone\n<br />- Passive demonhost\n<br />- Player outlines\n<br />- Knocked down/incapacitated player outlines\n<br />\n<br />Note: I tried changing changing the colour of the psyker's disrupt destiny targets but it wouldn't work, it's either not possible or it's using a different material name that I have no way of finding out.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Changing the priority allow you to decide which outline colour to show when an enemy or player is affected by multiple outlines, a lower value means higher priority.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The mod doesn't affect the inside mesh/skeleton colours, I haven't found if it can be changed and how, which means target highlighted by the executioner's stance will be yellow when they are hidden behind the decor for example.\n<br />\n<br />You need the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/39]Player Outlines[/url] mod to see the player outlines.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Russian localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2593497]xsSplater[/url]﻿\n<br />Simplified Chinese localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/users/127776653]deluxghost[/url]"
