nexusDescription="Adds several buttons to the inventory list menu:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Mastery - go to the selected weapon's mastery menu\n<br />[*]Entreat Hadron - go to the crafting menu with the selected weapon\n<br />[*]Sacrifice Weapons - go to the sacrifice menu with the selected weapon's category pre-selected\n<br />[/list]Each of these buttons can be assigned a hotkey; by default, \"Inspect\" is bound to V (because that was the hotkey for it in older versions of the game) and the rest are unbound. Additionally, the mod adds a Mastery button to the re-bless menu. Note that if you unlock a blessing from the re-bless crafting menu, it will appear greyed out, but you can still apply it; this is a purely visual bug. It fixes itself when you refresh the re-bless menu.\n<br />\n<br />Some of the code is based on [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/242]Direct to Hadron[/url] by [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Zombine04/]Zombine[/url] (with their permission); Zombine has also contributed several changes and fixes to this mod, so double thanks!\n<br />Simplified Chinese localization by [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/deluxghost/]deluxghost[/url]\n<br />Russian localization by [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xsSplater/]xsSplater[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://ko-fi.com/itsalxl][img]https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Source: [url=https://github.com/ItsAlxl/darktide-mods/tree/main/GoToMastery]GitHub[/url]"
