nexusDescription="[b]Requires Darktide Mod Framework version 24.07.12 or later.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Spare your joints - make all possible ranged weapons fully automatic, either by default or with a keypress. The mod will account for your weapon's fire rate and your current attack speed. Additionally, you can enable an option to have the weapon shoot for you when in full-auto mode.\n<br />\n<br />The mod now features the ability to automatically fire fully-charged shots from the Helbore lasgun and the various Psyker staffs.\n<br />\n<br />A HUD indicator will let you know if fully-automatic fire is currently enabled. This indicator can be moved using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/10]Custom HUD by Fracticality[/url].\n<br />\n<br />This mod works by basically spamming click for you, but in a way that should be more reliable and precise than a macro. It does not actually alter any gameplay or weapon behavior. Rest assured that this mod falls squarely within Fatshark's modding policy, so you don't have to worry about it being flagged as cheating.\n<br />\n<br />Also comes in \"melee\" flavor - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/88]KeepSwinging[/url] (by me). If you encounter issues with this mod or KeepSwinging, I recommend switching to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/510]Skitarius by Norkkom[/url]. That mod includes a \"quick start\" guide to recreate the functionality of these mods, as well as a lot more configurability on top of that.\n<br />\n<br />Simplified Chinese localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/127776653]deluxghost[/url]\n<br />Russian localization by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2593497]xsSplater[/url]﻿\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://ko-fi.com/itsalxl][img]https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />Code: [url=https://github.com/ItsAlxl/DarktideMods/tree/main/FullAuto]GitHub[/url]"
