nexusDescription="[size=4]----[/size]\n<br />[b][size=6]--GRIM PROTOCOL UPDATE--[/size][/b]\n<br />You may need to set the colours for the trapper indicator (the radial section, not the text warning one)  if you have left it default. Then reload mods, or restart your game to get rid of the excess of error messages\n<br />----\n<br />\n<br />On request from AutoGnomous on Reddit, this mod will add in warning arcs, much like the damage hit arcs to indicate direction of audio cues from the following events:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Barrels\n<br />[*]Bursters\n<br />[*]Crushers\n<br />[*]Daemonhost\n<br />[*]Flamers\n<br />[*]Grenadiers\n<br />[*]Hounds\n<br />[*]Maulers\n<br />[*]Mutants\n<br />[*]Rager\n<br />[*]Sniper\n<br />[*]Trappers\n<br />[*]Tox Bombers\n<br />[*]Backstabs\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />The indicators will only appear when the target is less than 40m from you (You can set the range within for each event)\n<br />\n<br />You can toggle each indicator on or off, change its colour, show only if behind you, and also change the distance it appears from the centre. \n<br />\n<br />There's also the option for Active Range, which will move the arc closer to the middle as the target approaches\n<br />\n<br />You can also specify a specific range for each type that will add an Alert icon to indicate they are particularly close\n<br />\n<br />All arc settings can be copied from one target type to another\n<br />\n<br />You can specify for the mod to warn if a net is fired within 15m or a cleave is swung within 10m (adjustable). These indicators can be customised for font/size/colour. I recommend using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/10]Custom HUD[/url] to move these indicators to your favourite spot. As these are tied to the relevant sound effects, please test this functionality in the Psykanium, so you can see how early/late it appears.\n<br />\n<br />There are text warnings for the following:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Trapper Nets\n<br />[*]Crusher Overheads\n<br />[*]Plague Ogryn Charges\n<br />[*]Shotgunners racking their shotgun\n<br />[*]Hounds about to pounce\n<br />[*]Sniper shots (only in solo play)\n<br />[/list]Many thanks to Jwako for their Coherency mod which inspired this, and Raindish for helping me figure out the hooks.\n<br />\n<br />[b]NB: If you have been having issues with the textures not showing correctly, there is an optional dependency now for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/211]Darktide Local Server[/url] which will serve the textures locally. Be sure to run it as indicated and load it before Spidey Sense in the mod load order.[/b]"
