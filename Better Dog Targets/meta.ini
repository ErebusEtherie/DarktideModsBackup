nexusDescription="Recolors dog target ping outlines to be the color assigned to the player pinging. Now you will be able to tell whose dog is set to which targets.\n<br />\n<br />New mod options are being able to select the color for the player slots. Yes, I know it's a lot of colors, and no, I can't make the scroll bar able to be grabbed.\n<br />\n<br />The reason why I can't set directly the color you want for each player is because the game determines the slot of the player. The easiest work around is to set the colors used for the outlines based on the slot the player is in (which changes every game).\n<br />\n<br />Update 1.3.2: fixed a crash due to conflict with another mod\n<br />Update 1.3.1: fixed warning message popping up\n<br />Update 1.3: Added options for hiding HUD markers (skull, arrow, distance text) and recoloring them to appropriate player slot colors.\n<br />Update 1.2: Now the colors update immediately after setting the options, no need to restart any more.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://github.com/Pfhoenix/BetterDogTargets]Github repo here[/url]"
