nexusDescription="[b]Dog Whistle[/b] is a mod that allows you to specify which enemies should be eligible to be targeted by your Cyber-Mastiff when playing as the Arbitrator.\n<br />This mod does not interfere with the standard method of targeting enemies for your dog to attack, and instead provides a new \"Whistle\" keybind for filtered targeting.\n<br />\n<br />When the \"Whistle\" keybind is held, the first available enemy that can be targeted according to the chosen filter settings will be marked as a target for your dog.\n<br />There is also an optional Auto-Target setting, which will automatically target enemies that are allowed by the chosen filter settings.\n<br />Filters can be set independently for each method of targeting. Enemies can be filtered individually, by category (Elite/Specialist/Boss), or globally (all on/off).\n<br />\n<br />Although this mod is was originally made for the Arbites/Arbitrator class, it can also be used for standard tagging on other classes. Filters and Whistle/Auto-Target settings can be set per-class, with extra settings for Focus Target Veteran.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is also available on [url=https://github.com/CATBIRDS/DogWhistle]GitHub[/url].[center]\n<br />[img]https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png[/img]﻿[/center][b]Mod Settings:[/b]\n<br />[i]Enable/Disable Mod:[/i] Toggles the mod on or off.\n<br />[i]Enable/Disable Mod (Toggle):[/i] Sets a keybind which when pressed will toggle the mod on or off.\n<br />[i]Notify on Mod Enabled/Disabled:[/i] If enabled, the mod will display a message indicating current mod status when toggled via keybind.\n<br />[i]Ignore Already Targeted Enemies:[/i] When enabled, the mod will not tag enemies already tagged by a teammate with the same tag.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Tag Prioritization:[/i] [u]This setting only applies to the Arbitrator class.[/u] It is a dropdown with three options:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][i]Cyber-Mastiff Attack Command:[/i] The mod will always allow Cyber-Mastiff Attack Commands to override Standard Tags, regardless of other settings.\n<br />[*][i]Standard Tag:[/i] The mod will always allow Standard Tags to override Cyber-Mastiff Attack Commands, regardless of other settings.\n<br />[*][i]None:[/i] The mod will not prioritize either tag over the other.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Whistle Settings:[/b]\n<br />[i]Whistle Keybind:[/i] When held, this keybind will tag enemies according to the current classes' Whistle filter settings.\n<br />[i]Whistle Tag Type:[/i] [u]This setting only applies to the Arbitrator class.[/u] It specifies the type of tag the Whistle will apply (Cyber-Mastiff Attack Command / Standard Tag).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Auto-Target Settings:[/b]\n<br />[i]Auto-Target:[/i] Enables/Disables Auto-Target.
