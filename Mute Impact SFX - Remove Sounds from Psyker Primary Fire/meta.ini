nexusDescription="Uses the Audio plugin to mute the listed sounds. All sounds are silenced by default, and can be unsilenced in the Mod Options.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u]Load Order[/u][/size]\n<br />[b]DarktideLocalServer\n<br />Audio[/b]\n<br />[i]whatever other Audio mods[/i]\n<br />[b]MuteImpacts[/b]\n<br />[i]whatever other mods[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u]FAQ[/u][/size]\n<br />[b]Why does this need to use the Audio Plugin?[/b]\n<br />It's the simplest way to do it. AFAIK editing the weapon sounds directly (if that's even possible since they're in the weapon files with stats) would lead to autodefenestration. Perhaps there's a way to do it like ZipIt by finding the actual audio playing functions but I don't have much time to be digging that much nowadays."
