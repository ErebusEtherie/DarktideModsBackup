nexusDescription="With the Path of Redemption update, Sister Hestia Prine's Shrine Penitentax was added to the game.\n<br />\n<br />Now that we have a much larger density of penances available, we needed a tool to help filter down what's on the screen to just what we need.\n<br />\n<br />This mod will add a set of filters to filter the penance tab to only show earnt/unearnt/unclaimed penances and adds a search box to filter the penances on the screen down to specific keywords\n<br />\n<br />You can also increase the number of favourites you want shown in the tab screen while in-game. Use the up/down arrow keys/mouse wheel to scroll through them (Note, scrolling will also affect your wielded weapon). Only 5 will be shown at a time due to space restrictions\n<br />\n<br />There will be a bookmark indicator on the category that contains any favourited penances for easy access."
