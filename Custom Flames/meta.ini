nexusDescription="[size=4]\n<br />This mod adds the ability to modify the Flamer and Flamestaff styles and colors seperately.\n<br />\n<br />This changes how [i]you[/i] see the flames, it does not affect unmodded players. Think of it like special goggles that change your view of the world.\n<br />\n<br />Styles allow for cleaner/less flames, short-ranged blasts, small puffs, and, of course, the default style.\n<br />\n<br />Colors let you choose from both normal orange/blue fire, but also let you use enemy flame types, too!\n<br />[i]Note: As enemy flame types work differently, they are NOT customizable, unfortunately.\n<br />\n<br />[/i]Both flamer and flamestaff can have two different colors/styles, or even the same!\n<br />\n<br />NEW UPDATE: Now you can have enemy flamer charge up sounds with the Flamestaff! Toggle in options.\n<br />\n<br />Fixed: Ground particles for enemy flames are much less intrusive, and added options for enabling nurgle ground particles.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Known bug: In the Psykhanium, if you have an enemy flame type selected, you will see additional particle effects when firing near the middle of the map.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />1. Download the file, it will be zipped. First, extract it.\n<br />2. Inside, there is the CustomFlames folder.\n<br />3. Go to steam, on your game list on the left, right click Darktide -&gt; Manage -&gt; Browse local files.\n<br />4. Go to mods (If there is no mods folder, go to Darktide Modding Framework and follow instructions to install the foundation for mods) and drop [size=4][size=4]CustomFlames [/size][/size]into the mods folder.\n<br />5. In the mods folder, open mod_load_order.txt and add in the line \"[size=4][size=4]CustomFlames[/size][/size]\" down below.\n<br />6. Make sure toggle_darktide_mods is enabled in the Darktide install folder, too!\n<br />7. Enjoy![/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Frequently Asked Questions:[/b]\n<br />Q: Can you make custom RGB colors for flames/lightning?\n<br />A: Sorry, not at this moment. While there [i]might[/i] be a way to modify the values of the color directly, no one in the modding community has figured out what those material variables are called, so until then, the best I can do is replace the flame effects with what's currently existing. I, too, wish for rainbow flames!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Modding takes a lot of time and effort to do right!

I'm willing to discuss requests and see what I can do! Feel free to contact me and ask, it's no bother &lt;3\n<br />[/size]"
