nexusDescription="[size=4][b]Ancestor's Guidance - A Darkest Dungeon Audio Mod\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[i]\"Ruin has come to Atoma...\"\n<br />[/i]\n<br />This mod replaces in-game event triggers with narration clips from the Ancestor from Darkest Dungeon I and II.\n<br />\n<br />Here's a little trailer of what to expect with this audio mod:\n<br />[youtube]YUToINMEMJw[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:[/b]\n<br />•    634 hand-picked voice lines and organized into 20+ categories\n<br />•    In the Mod Options, you can enable/disable each narration categories and adjust their volume individually to your preference! There is also a Master Volume to quickly set all volumes to the same value!\n<br />•    Includes a 5-second global cooldown to prevent overlapping narration spam\n<br />[size=4]•[/size] [/size][size=1]*NEW*[/size][size=4] Added a slider to each category that controls the chance (1–100%) of audio playing. This allows you to reduce the frequency of certain categories without disabling them entirely.\n<br />\n<br />• [b]Voice lines activate during these events:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Medicae interactions (different states: depleted, healing, recharging)\n<br />[*]Mourningstar Hubs (Armoury, Crafting, Psykhanium, Contracts, etc.)\n<br />[*]Combat events (boss spawns, hordes, monster kills)\n<br />[*]Mission related (character selection, mission start, victory/defeat)\n<br />[*]Exploration (Opening chest –5% chance of triggering by default–)\n<br />[*]Teammates (teammate downed/death)\n<br />[*]Mortis Trials (Wave starting)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[i]In loving memory of Wayne June, whose incredible voice work brought the Ancestor to life.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[quote]Special Thanks:\n<br />•    SeventeenDucks for the essential Audio plugin\n<br />•    The Darktide modding community for their support\n<br />•    My friend (Artrópode?) for playtesting and general feedback![/quote][u]\n<br />Let me know if you encounter any bugs, if the volume on 100% is too low or any suggestions you have[/u]!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />1. Install the requirements (Darktide Mod Framework, Darktide Mod Loader, Darktide Local Server and\n<br />Audio Plugin)\n<br />2. Install AncestorsGuidance\n<br />3. Add it to your mod_load_order.txt and the order should be:\n<br />\n<br />[code]DarktideLocalServer\n<br />Audio\n<br />AncestorsGuidance\n<br />[/code]\n<br />*[/size][size=2]AncestorsGuidance doesn’t have to be placed right after Audio—you can put it at the end of your load order if you prefer. The only requirement is that it comes after Audio.[/size][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />4. [b]Make sure on Darktide Mod Framework the Developer Mode and Show DeveloperConsole are set to \"ON\"[/b]\n<br />5. [b]Make sure to set your preferred volume on the Mod Options! [/b]The audio file itself is normalized for -3 dB peak but every setup is different.\n<br />6. [b]Have fun! [/b]Let me know in the comments if you liked!\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]**[b]Since I can't test it on Gamepass, I think this audio mod won't work on it (Audio Plugin doesn't support it from what I heard)[/b][/size]\n<br />[/size]"
