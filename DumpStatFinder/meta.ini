nexusDescription="[size=3][b]v0.94.2\n<br />Fix for crashing on buttons with new patch, 2 dummy placeholders for spacing were added behind the scenes in FS's Lua. There appears to have been sometimes breaking changes in patch with sorting IF you're using a sorting mod like ItemSorting that also broke, be sure to update it as it interferes with filtering if it's outdated (or disable it). [/b]The FS grid filtering (which is unused) was changed and is now passed to the sorting function, so if a sorting mod breaks the sorting it will also break the filtering but errors in those pieces are suppressed.\n<br />[b][b]\n<br />v0.94\n<br />[/b][/b][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3][b][b]UI in Mod Options/Settings to set filters. [/b]Previous [b]external Lua settings files are no longer used.[/b][/b][/size]\n<br />[size=3]I'm trying to avoid too much UI work that goes beyond what the settings allow so a flattened table with a slider to add more filter \"rows\" is used.[b][b] [/b][/b][/size][size=3]Adding/removing rows requires mod reload, typically a game restart.\n<br />The names and patterns are auto-generated from the game files so no customization beyond that (may add more in the future, all down to time+).\n<br />[/size][size=3][b]Note:[/b] Old filters are not transferred as they are incompatible, use the Mod Options UI (F4) to quickly set them back.[b][b]\n<br />[/b][/b][/size][*][size=3]Special extra function for more complex rules (to avoid complex UI for now), Ripper and Plasma. If it find a perfect special it will auto-mark it as favorite. Items meeting special filters are marked with a * after name.[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Ripper Ammo [62..66] (for blessing trigger per shot like Inspiring Barrage)+Collateral+Stability[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Plasma Charge [62..72]+Thermal [62..72][/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]   ﻿Ripper ammo 66+dumps, Plasma Heat 69+Charge71 are Perfect Specials and will be marked as favorites+notification will show.\n<br />If people want a more complex UI likes sliders per pattern I can maybe implement it, but I felt there wasn't really a need beyond some special filters in the additional function.\n<br />[/size][*][size=3]Option to use the in-game hidden Sainted colors and text[/size]\n<br />[*]Some internal tweaks and cleanup\n<br />[/list][b]Please report any issues with new version, [/b]I was hoping to avoid extra work, mostly UI/UX but it seem a few people really wanted some UI etc.[size=3][b][b]\n<br />[/b][/b][/size][size=3][b][b]v0.89\n<br />[/b][/b][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3][size=3]More default [/size]granular weapon pattern groups broken down by sub-type [/size][size=2](family/type/variant) [/size][size=3]for filters [size=3]in DumpStatFinderSettings.lua([b]remember [/b]to copy over your old modified/added custom filters and/or make a copy of old file for safety)[/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]added the new weapons in DumpStatRestrictions.lua listing the stats for weapon patterns as a reference (if needed, in zip)[/size]\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]null check for button function that may get called with controller binding, causing a crash[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]\n<br />[b]\n<br />v0.88 (old filter format now obsolete in new versions, use UI)\n<br />[/b][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Added support for new weapons and 3 default filters in DumpStatFinderSettings.lua([b]remember [/b]to copy over your old modified/added custom filters)[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]    \"force_swords_2h/loc_stats_display_warp_resist_stat\",\n<br />    \"ogryn_heavystubbers_p2/loc_stats_display_control_stat_ranged\",\n<br />    \"ogryn_heavystubbers_p2/loc_stats_display_range_stat\",\n<br />\n<br />The 3 new weapon groups in the filter file are force_swords_2h, ogryn_heavystubbers_p2 and power_swords_2h.[/size][size=4][size=4]\n<br />[b]\n<br />New: [/b]Added Perfect Stat Curios, Right-Click on [Dump Stats] and [Favorites] for inverse filter, NOT dump stats, NOT favorites\n<br />\n<br />While you are typing text in the text filter input field and the caret is flashing, hotkeys won't work ([/size][size=4]Z and C disabed[/size][size=4]). Click a button to stop typing and hotkeys will work again.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Hourly Shop will show combined slots for quicker purchases.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][/size][size=3]Quirks can usually be resolved by exiting inventory screen and/or [Reset] button. It nudges some UI elements a bit too to make room. [/size][size=4]\n<br />[/size][size=4]\n<br />[b]Search Filter:[/b]\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />Type in some text to search for and hit [Filter] (a simple text filter) or [Dump Stat] or [Favorites] Text allows multiple terms to be broken up with &amp; operator.\n<br />e.g. \n<br />[code]﻿Power &amp;cycler\n<br />[/code]\n<br />Will find power sword with Power Cycler blessings, blessing are prefixed with \"b:\" invisibly to help search, if needed.\n<br />[code]Duel &amp;rip &amp;Unc\n<br />[/code]Will find Dueling swords with Riposte and Uncanny Strike, if you omit the \"Duel\" part it will find anything with Uncanny Strike &amp;Riposte e.g. combat knives and dueling swords.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />A Pattern filter was hastily added but it's usually quicker to search by text for weapon and blessing(s) (pattern not used with text filter). Select a pattern then click one of the filter buttons to apply it in conjunction with.\n<br />\n<br />Filter Inventory View Weapon List on Dump Stats &lt;= 62 (change it in Mod Options)\n<br />It considers the stat values as if the item was empowered to 500, using FS Lua script functions.\n<br />[size=3]Once the list is filtered you can mark them all as Favorite to facilitate discarding (prevent selling).\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[/size][/size][size=4][b]Usage:[/b][/size][size=3][size=3]\n<br />[Dump Stats] Filters list on dump stat items (and text if any) Right-Click for inverse (negated)\n<br />[Favorites] Filters list on favorited items[size=3][size=3] (and text if any)[/size][/size] [size=3][size=3]Right-Click for inverse (negated)[/size][/size]\n<br />[Reset] clears filters/reset list, *use before discarding[/size][size=5].[/size][size=3] [b]*If [/b]it's a bit weird right now, exit inventory and re-enter to properly refresh.\n<br />[Favorite these] Mark the current list items as Favorite\n<br />[size=3][Unfavorite these] Clear [size=3][size=3]the current list [/size][/size] items' Favorite mark[/size][/size]\n<br />[Pattern] Filter on a pattern and other filter, not used with text filter.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Some of the Current Filters:\n<br />[/b][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=3]Defense[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Mobility[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Plasma Vent Speed or Ammo (for charged shots?)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Charge Speed[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Ripper and Stubber Collateral (Control)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3][size=3]Ripper and Stubber Ammo(e.g. 62= 1 proc per shot for Blaze Away)[/size][/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Lasgun Ammo[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Power Sword Cleave (for Sunder)[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Grenade Gauntlets Melee[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=3]If a weapon has both Defense and Mobility like Chain Axe, the sum &lt; 140 is considered a dump stat (bug: appears in list twice)\n<br />[/size][size=3]\n<br />[b]You can change some of the default dump stat filters if you like.[/b]\n<br />E.G. Plasma I added both Ammo and Vent in case someone wanted to play with the new charged blessings or stock up some for the future.\n<br />\n<br />You can edit the file &#92;mods&#92;DumpStatFinder&#92;scripts&#92;mods&#92;DumpStatFinder&#92;[b]DumpStatFinderSettings.lua\n<br />[/b][size=3]Add a [b]--[/b] before the relevant filter line under [b]dump_stat_display_name_list[/b] at the top (table|array) entry to comment it out or delete the line.[/size][b]\n<br />[/b]e.g.\n<br />[code]--\"plasma_rifles/loc_stats_display_ammo_stat\",[/code]\n<br />[b]Note[/b]: [/size]If you want to add more filters the syntax is: [code]\"family_name/stat_display_name\"[/code],[size=3] you can get a list of the stat display names in the optional file in the Files section or DumpStatRestrictions.lua in zip, the optional file may occasionally be updated indepedantly. Some weapon family types like Combat Axes can have different display names across marks, Cleave for Antax vs Finesse for Rashad though mobility is usually the universal \"dump stat\".\n<br />\n<br />[b]Recolor [/b]dump stat items with options for backgrounds, text and max 500 or all, see mod option.\n<br />Limited selection of colors picked (by me), add your own named colors if you like. See [url=http://davidbau.com/colors/]Web/CSS named colors[/url] for samples\n<br />BUT the names need underscore separating word like dark_color, see all the named [url=https://github.com/Aussiemon/Darktide-Source-Code/blob/master/scripts/foundation/utilities/color.lua]DT colors[/url] in which mirrors the CSS ones\n<br />[b]Add your custom named colors to [/b]the lists in DumpStatFinder_data.lua, adding them to the colors_light list will make let you choose them from. I could just add custom colors too if people want it and/or longer lists.\n<br />Note: replaces built-in item color selection function, doesn't chain with other mods; I can add chaining if people need it. Turn off both recolors if you don't want it replacing existing functions or other modded ones.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Disclaimer[/b]: [b]double-check final discard list before discarding items[/b], it helped me clear hundreds of items on 1 character alone, but [b]a work in progress [/b]nonetheless. \n<br />Set your own filters for stuff you may want [size=5]to keep [/size]and batch favorite them or manually favorite them.\n<br />[/size]The shops are seeded with perfect dump stat weapons, both the regular hourly Armoury Exchange and Brunt's, do stock up on a few copies of each for different loadouts and blessing combinations."
