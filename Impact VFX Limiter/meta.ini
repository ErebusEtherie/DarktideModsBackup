nexusDescription="Darktide's performance isn't great, so I made a mod that makes it slightly better.\n<br />\n<br />Normally, an infinite number of flesh/armor (hitting enemies) impact and surface (hitting walls, floors, ceilings) impact VFX can play per frame, this is ok, but it results in situations where if multiple people are fighting hordes, there's tons of simulated blood decals, blood effects, and bullet impacts from enemies being pierced or shot simultaneously, which can really put a strain on weak GPUs and CPUs.\n<br />\n<br />This mod allows you to set a maximum amount of effects that play per frame, essentially limiting the amount of mayhem that can happen all at once, the default value for this is 5, but you can set it up to 100 per frame, which is more than enough.\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, whenever the game wants to cast blood decals, it spawns an invisible dynamic physics object to simulate the travel time of blood. A invisible \"blood ball\". This happens every time you strike an enemy and they bleed from what I can tell, from even horde enemies like Poxwalkers to monstrosities. Only a maximum of 16 can be spawned per frame, however, it has a queue, meaning it can spawn 16 simulated physics objects for the sake of [i]blood decals [/i]every frame depending on the amount of carnage going on, and you could easily end up with upwards of 20+ blood decal objects flying around being simulated for a few frames.\n<br />\n<br />My mod adds an option to simplify the blood decal behavior, making it a one-and-done raycast that projects linearly with a maximum range of 7.5 meters based on where you hit the enemy, with instant travel time, therefore saving a bunch of performance. The default value is on by default.\n<br />\n<br />There's an additional option to alter the particle effects for ground fire effects from enemies to use cheaper alternatives."
