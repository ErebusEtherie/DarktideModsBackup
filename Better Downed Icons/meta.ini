nexusDescription="[b]Better Downed Indicators[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Replaces the generic exclamation point icon on teammate and personal HUD panels with specific icons that show exactly what's happening. Instead of wondering why someone has an exclamation mark, you'll see if they're pounced by a hound, netted by a trapper, healing at a medicae station, or using an auspex scanner.\n<br />\n<br />This makes it much clearer how to respond to each situation and improves team coordination.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- 16+ unique status icons for different player states\n<br />- Multiple icon styles: glowing or plain colored variants\n<br />- Full RGB color customization for each status\n<br />- Automatically detects player states including interactions, equipment, and enemy attacks\n<br />- Optional background tinting that dims player portraits when they have active status icons\n<br />- Works for all players in multiplayer (network-synced)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Detected Status Icons[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Death &amp; Respawn: Dead, Respawning\n<br />\n<br />Downed &amp; Disabled: Knocked Down, Hogtied, Hanging\n<br />\n<br />Enemy Attacks: Pounced, Netted, Warp-grabbed, Consumed, Grabbed, Mutant-charged\n<br />\n<br />Active States: Auspex, Luggable, Healing, Helping, Interacting\n<br />\n<br />[b]Configuration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Icon Style: Choose between glowing icons (default) or plain colored variants (white, yellow, red, or teammate color).\n<br />\n<br />[b]Plain Icon Customization Mode:[/b]\n<br />- Off: Standard behavior, uses your selected Icon Style\n<br />- Customize All Icons: All icons use plain versions with custom RGB colors\n<br />- Only Customize Plain Icons: Only icons without distinct plain versions get custom colors; icons with distinct versions stay glowly (only works when Icon Style is \"glowing\")\n<br />\n<br />Color Customization: Each status has individual RGB controls (0-255 for Red, Green, Blue). Icons marked as \"(glowy customizable)\" can be customized even when using glowly icons.\n<br />\n<br />Background Tint: Optional setting that dims player portraits when they have active status icons.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation[/b]\n<br />\n<br />1. Extract to your Darktide mods folder (usually `%LocalAppData%&#92;Mods&#92;`)\n<br />2. Folder structure should be: `Mods&#92;better_downed_indicators&#92;`\n<br />3. Launch Darktide with mod loader enabled\n<br />4. Enable the mod in your mod list\n<br />5. Configure settings in-game via the Mods menu\n<br />\n<br />The mod works automatically once enabled. Icons appear on teammate HUD panels and your personal panel, updating in real-time as statuses change.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Tips[/b]\n<br />\n<br />- Use different colors for different status categories (red for danger, green for positive actions)\n<br />- Bright, contrasting colors work well for critical statuses like \"Pounced\" or \"Netted\"\n<br />- The glowing style is recommended for best visibility\n<br />- Custom colors only apply when using plain icon styles or when customization mode is enabled\n<br />\n<br />[b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Compatible with ProfilePictures mod and most other HUD modifications.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Troubleshooting[/b]\n<br />\n<br />If icons aren't showing, make sure the mod is enabled and try restarting the game. If colors aren't applying, check that your customization mode is set correctly and RGB values are within 0-255 range."
