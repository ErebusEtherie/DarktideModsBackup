nexusDescription="[font=Times New Roman][size=6]-Multi-Bind-[/size][/font][size=5][font=Times New Roman]\n<br />\n<br />After hours of rebuilding this mod entirely from the ground up, here is the new and improved Multiple Keybindings mod!\n<br />\n<br />This lets you have a secondary keybinding for any action, so you can have reload be both 'R' and 'Mouse4' if you want, for example. In addition, you can unbind anything in the normal keybindings page, if there's anything in particular you hate (Goodbye jump button!)\n<br />[/font][/size][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />1. Download the file, it will be zipped. First, extract it.\n<br />2. Inside, there is the MultiBind folder.\n<br />3. Go to steam, on your game list on the left, right click Darktide -&gt; Manage -&gt; Browse local files.\n<br />4. Go to mods (If there is no mods folder, go to Darktide Modding \n<br />Framework and follow instructions to install the foundation for mods) \n<br />and drop [/size][size=4]MultiBind[/size] [size=4]into the mods folder.\n<br />5. In the mods folder, open mod_load_order.txt and add in the line \"[/size][size=4]MultiBind[/size][size=4]\" down below.\n<br />6. Make sure toggle_darktide_mods is enabled in the Darktide install folder, too!\n<br />7. Enjoy!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Modding takes a lot of time and effort to do right!

I'm willing to discuss \n<br />requests and see what I can do! Feel free to contact me and ask, it's no\n<br /> bother &lt;3[/size]"
