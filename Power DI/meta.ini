nexusDescription="[b][size=5][color=#e69138]Power DI[/color]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4]Description[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Power DI is a framework for collecting, transforming and displaying Darktide statistical data.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Notable features[/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Customize reports to your liking, or even create them from scratch, all from within the ui.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Power DI records events as source data, which means you can create new reports and gain new insights even after a mission has concluded.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]The auto save feature will periodically save all recorded data to disk, so in the event of a game crash or disconnect you can just continue where you left off.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Inspect what gear and build players were using in any of your recorded sessions.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]API available for adding new data sources, datasets and report templates to Power DI[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4][b]Core concepts\n<br />[/b][/size][size=2]Power DI is build around the following three core concepts:\n<br />[/size][list=1]\n<br />[*][size=2]Data sources. Events are recorded to data sources, which is the source data in it's rawest form, and requires additional transformations to make them readable.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Data sets. One more data sources can be combined to create a dataset. A dataset is a formatted table containing all the information needed to create reports.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Reports. A report is generated from a dataset, and creates a specific view of that data by displaying it in a structured way.[/size]\n<br />[/list][size=2]\n<br />[/size][size=4][b]GitHub[/b][/size][b][size=4] repository\n<br />[/size][/b]The GitHub repository of this project can be found at: [url=https://github.com/OvenProofMars/Power_DI]Power DI\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]User guide\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[/url][size=4][b]Reports screen\n<br />[/b][/size][img]https://i.imgur.com/xS1P0Nw.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[size=2]The reports screen, for selecting and viewing reports.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*][size=2]Sessions tab.
