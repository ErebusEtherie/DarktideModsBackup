nexusDescription="Adds an in-game widget keeping track of your melee combo, showing your drawn weapon's combo pattern, the attack you are performing and the attacks you can combo into next.\n<br />\n<br />[b]This modification is highly customizable and lets you personalize:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]The widget's vertical and horizontal position\n<br />[*]The colour (RGB &amp; Opacity) of the widget frame, default attack icon, active attack icon and next attack icon\n<br />[*]The fade in / out time of the widget\n<br />[*]Visibility of the widget outside of the Psykhanium\n<br />[*]Whether potential next attacks should be highlighted\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Important Notes:[/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Weapons possess unique attacks that cannot be reached with a normal combo - push attack follow-ups, foldable shovels' unique strikedowns when folded, combat knives' unique special follow-ups etc. Attacks outside of the normal combo pattern are not highlighted. However, if an attack outside of the normal combo pattern can transition back into the combo, next possible attacks are highlighted.\n<br />[*]Some weapons have outright wrong combo pattern data - i.e. the Munitorum Mk III Power Sword has 3 light attacks in its light combo, going 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3..., similarly to the Maccabian Mk IV Dueling Sword, yet the game states that the Power Sword has only 2 light attacks, while the Maccabian has 3. It is a discrepancy on Fatshark's end.\n<br />[*]Chinese localization by deluxghost\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Known issues:\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Widget may sometimes be still (not show current and next attacks) on player spawn. Swapping to your ranged weapon and back to melee fixes this.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[/list]"
