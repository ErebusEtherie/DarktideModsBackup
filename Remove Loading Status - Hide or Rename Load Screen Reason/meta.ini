nexusDescription="Status messages were added to loading screens in Hotfix #53 (1.5.11). This removes the displayed text.\n<br />\n<br />Covers:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]﻿Read from disk\n<br />[*]﻿Dedicated server\n<br />[*]﻿Waiting for player(s)\n<br />[*]﻿Backend\n<br />[*]﻿Store\n<br />[*]Platform (Xbox, PSN, Steam)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=4]Editing the file[/size]\n<br />On the technical side, this simply replaces the text with an empty string. You can change this to whatever you want by editing [i]RemoveLoadingStatus.lua[/i] with any text editor.\n<br />\n<br />This mod only defines messages in English. For removing the message, this is the default value and will automatically apply to all other languages. To add custom messages in your language, see the [i]readme.md[/i] file.\n<br />[s]If you don't want to deal with that, install the Mr. Worldwide Edition. This supports all languages automatically by using What the Localization (so make sure that's installed). I've made this a separate file because using WTL technically has a (very very very) small performance overhead. It's nothing noticeable, but it's the principle of things. Also if anyone wants to copy this code, you got two implementations to look at :3[/s]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Compatibility[/size]\n<br />Custom messages work with additions from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/438]gpk's LessAnnoyingLoading[/url]. Load order does NOT matter. If you use LessAnnoyingLoading to disable the text, you don't need this mod."
