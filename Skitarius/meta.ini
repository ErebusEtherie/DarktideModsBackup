nexusDescription="[quote]﻿Flesh is fallible, but ritual honours the Machine Spirit.\n<br />   ﻿   ﻿- The Warnings of the Cult Mechanicus[/quote]\n<br />Skitarius is a mod that allows you to execute custom sequences of actions, with a multitude of additional features.\n<br />It is recommended you read (or at least skim) this description page to ensure you understand how the mod works before using it.\n<br />\n<br />This mod is also available on [url=https://github.com/CATBIRDS/Skitarius]GitHub[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features:[/b]\n<br />Allows for setting custom melee sequences up to twelve steps in length\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Sequences can be applied globally (to all melee weapons), or uniquely per-weapon\n<br />[*]Up to eight unique keybinds can be set (four toggled, four held), each with their own sequence settings\n<br />[*]In addition to standard keybinds, the primary attack input can also be overridden with a sequence (acting as a ninth, held keybind)\n<br />[*]An optional and resizeable HUD element can be displayed to indicate when keybinds are active\n<br />[*]Sequences can be given custom cycle (loop) points, with extra options to modify the behavior of certain attacks\n<br />[/list]Allows for setting custom automatic fire modes for ranged weapons\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Can automatically fire normal attacks, charged attacks, or special actions (including charged/heavy specials)\n<br />[*]Same keybind/per-weapon customization options available as for melee weapons\n<br />[*]Automatic fire can be restricted to only affect weapons when aiming or hipfiring\n<br />[*]Weapon rate of fire is customizeable, with aimed and hipfire rates defined separately\n<br />[*]Custom charge levels can be set for charged attacks\n<br />[*]Optional global toggle which will auto-release charged attacks regardless of any other settings\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Melee Settings:[/b]\n<br />[i]Weapon Selection[/i]: The weapon which the current settings will be applied for. Select \"GLOBAL\" to apply to all weapons.\n<br />[i]Keybind Selection[/i]: The keybind which will trigger the current settings.\n<br />[i]Heavy Buff Modifier[/i]: If selected, this buff will be used for the \"Heavy Buff Stacks\" setting.\n<br />[i]Heavy Buff Stacks[/i]: Heavy attacks will wait for this number of buff stacks before releasing. This setting is ignored if set to 0, or if the current weapon lacks the selected buff.\n<br />[i]Special Required for Heavy Modifier[/i]: If enabled, heavy attacks will only check for buff stacks if the weapon's special action is active.\n<br />[i]Always Activate Special Actions[/i]: If enabled, weapons will always trigger special actions in sequences, regardless of weapon state.\n<br />[i]Force Heavies When Special Active[/i]: If enabled, the current weapon sequence will be overridden with heavy attacks while the weapon's special state is active.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Cycle Point[/i]: When the sequence completes, the step specified by this setting will be used as the starting point for the next iteration of the sequence.\n<br />\n<br />[i]JUMP TO CURRENT/GLOBAL[/i]: When clicked, the mod will select the currently equipped melee weapon. If this weapon is already selected, it will instead select GLOBAL.\n<br />[i]Reset Melee Weapon[/i]: When clicked, ALL settings for the currently selected weapon across all keybinds will be reset to defaults.\n<br />[i]Reset All Melee Settings[/i]: When clicked, ALL melee settings will be reset to defaults, across all weapons and keybinds.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Ranged Settings:[/b]\n<br />[i]Always Auto-Release Charges[/i]: When enabled, the mod will automatically fire at max charge regardless of any other settings. All other Ranged Settings are weapon and keybind specific.\n<br />[i]Always Auto-Release Charge Threshold %[/i]: This is the threshold that will be used by the Always Auto-Release Charges setting. When Always Auto-Release Charges is enabled, this is effectively the maximum charge any ranged weapon can be charged to, as it will override other threshold settings.\n<br />\n<br />[i]Weapon Selection[/i]: The weapon which the current settings will be applied for. Select \"GLOBAL\" to apply to all weapons.\n<br />[i]Keybind Selection[/i]: The keybind which will trigger the current settings.\n<br />[i]Automatic Fire[/i]: The selected option will be triggered in rapid succession when the selected keybind is triggered. \n<br />   ﻿[i]Automatic Fire Options:[/i]\n<br />   ﻿Standard: Fires the weapon normally.\n<br />   ﻿Charged: Charges the weapon, releasing at maximum charge or the specified charge threshold.\n<br />   ﻿Special: Triggers the weapon's special action.\n<br />   ﻿Special (Charged): Triggers the weapon's \"charged\" special action, such as Helbore/Staff heavy attacks.\n<br />   ﻿Special + Standard: Fires normally if the weapon's special is activated, and activates the weapon's special if it is inactive.\n<br />[i]Charge Threshold %[/i]: A selection between 0-100; when charge levels reach the specified percentage, they will be released. This setting only applies to charged attacks made with the Automatic Fire setting, and do not impact the behavior of the Always Auto-Release Charges setting.\n<br />[i]ADS/Hipfire Filter[/i]: When set to \"ADS Only\", the selected Automatic Fire will only trigger while aiming. When set to \"Hipfire Only\", it will only trigger when not aiming. By default, this is set to \"ADS and Hipfire\", which will always trigger the selected Automatic Fire when the keybind is triggered.\n<br />[i]ADS Attack Delay (ms)[/i]: Delay in milliseconds applied between each shot while aiming.\n<br />[i]Hipfire Attack Delay (ms)[/i]: Delay in milliseconds applied between each shot when not aiming.\n<br />\n<br />[i]JUMP TO CURRENT/GLOBAL[/i]: When clicked, the mod will select the currently equipped ranged weapon. If this weapon is already selected, it will instead select GLOBAL.\n<br />[i]Reset Ranged Weapon[/i]: When clicked, ALL settings for the currently selected weapon across all keybinds will be reset to defaults.\n<br />[i]Reset All Ranged Settings[/i]: When clicked, ALL ranged settings will be reset to defaults, across all weapons and keybinds.\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTE:[/i]\n<br />Weapons which are already automatic by default do not play nice with the Rate of Fire settings. There is a minimum window set by the game for how quickly the gun can attempt to manually shoot, and it cannot be overridden. If inputs are within this window, it fires at full firerate, regardless of input timings. If inputs are outside of this window, an extra delay is forced upon the weapon.\n<br />This means that Rate of Fire settings will not apply at all to these weapons until they are set low enough to push the weapon outside of its \"minimum window\", at which point the rate of fire drops drastically. There is unfortunately no way to achieve a rate of fire in between these two extremes for natively automatic weapons. This mechanic also applies to the charged attacks of Force Staffs.\n<br />[center]﻿[/center][center]\n<br />[img]https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//38365286/a65c70af1027202631df9d22270d8a366b72f32d.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[b]Quick-Start Guide:[/b]\n<br />This mod was originally created to merge the functionality of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/476]UngaBunga[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/88]KeepSwinging[/url],and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/87]FullAuto[/url]. Although it now offers much more, below are steps to easily replicate those mods for users interested in replacing them.\n<br />\n<br />[i]UngaBunga[/i]:\n<br />In Melee Settings, set the desired weapon's Step One setting to \"Heavy Attack\".\n<br />To match UngaBunga's default input settings, set the desired weapon's Keybind Selection to \"Override Primary Attack Input\". This will trigger heavies when you hold your normal attack input (e.g. left mouse button).\n<br />If you would like to block-cancel or special-cancel, set Step Two to either \"Block\" or \"Special Action\".\n<br />Skitarius has the same options as UngaBunga to allow charging Heavy attacks dependent on Thrust/Slow-And-Steady/Crunch stacks, with an additional toggle to only apply these modifications when the weapon's Special Action is active.\n<br />\n<br />[i]NOTE:[/i] \n<br />This mod may cause input conflicts when used with UngaBunga, and may not function properly as a result. It is recommended you disable UngaBunga while this mod is in use.\n<br />\n<br />[i]KeepSwinging[/i]:\n<br />In Melee Settings, set the desired weapon's Sequence Step One to \"Light Attack\". Similar to setting up the mod to mimic UngaBunga, you can use a dedicated keybind to trigger these light attacks, or use the \"Override Primary Attack Input\" Keybind Selection to trigger them with your normal attack input.\n<br />\n<br />[i]FullAuto[/i]:\n<br />In Ranged Settings, set the desired weapon's Automatic Fire to \"Standard\" for automatic fire.\n<br />Similar to FullAuto, ranged weapons can also be made to fire charged attacks (if applicable) with the \"Charge\" option, or Special Actions with the \"Special\" option.\n<br />If a ranged weapon is incapable of charged attacks, setting Automatic Fire to \"Charged\" will do nothing.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Sequencing Information:\n<br />[/b]Sequences will be reset if the player is knocked out of their own combo by enemies (e.g. during stuns), and inputs will be delayed if the player is in a state which cannot execute the next step of the sequence (e.g. sprinting while attempting to perform an action that cannot be performed while sprinting). Sequences also do not know (or care) about the specifics of weapon combos, which is intentional to maintain their flexibility. This means that an input of \"Light Attack\" may produce the Light 1, Light 2, or Light 3 for a given weapon, depending on when the input is initiated - but the mod only is interested in knowing that a \"Light Attack\" was requested and should be performed. Using the Cycle Point setting can help to guide weapon-specific combos.\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, be aware that sequence steps are already at their \"most simple\" state. If you want to trigger a push-attack, you should select the \"Push Attack\" step option, rather than attempting to \"build\" it from other steps. For example, selecting \"Push\" followed by \"Light Attack\" will make the mod perform each of these actions individually, rather than combining them into a push-attack.\n<br />\n<br />When building sequences, keep in mind that not all weapons are capable of following all possible sequences. The mod will dutifully attempt to  execute any sequence you provide it with, but it may have improper results if the weapon itself cannot handle the sequence.\n<br />\n<br />[i]For example[/i]: \n<br />The Grenadier Gauntlet will not be able to properly execute sequences containing the \"Block\" action, because the Grenadier Gauntlet cannot block. \n<br />\n<br />If you're unsure what a weapon allows, test it in the Psykhanium. If, after testing, you think the weapon should be capable of executing a particular sequence that the mod is refusing to perform, make a post about it and I can investigate.\n<br />\n<br />Chinese localization provided by jcyl2023 and SyuanTsai."
