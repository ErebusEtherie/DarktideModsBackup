nexusDescription="(Formerly LessAnnoyingDog)The older LessAnnoyingDog is still there if you want it for some reason.[size=5][b]\n<br />Update[/b]: renamed and consolidated into LessAnnoyingArbites mod, new features, better attack, tweaks and single keybind, Nuncio tweaks, some Arbites VFX tweaks, Mine tweaks. \n<br />[/size][size=3]See pictures of settings for more details.[/size][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Tips:\n<br />[/b][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=4]Set Double-tap delay to 200ms to avoid too many false attacks if you want to keep that functionality. One or more extra mouse index buttons make good attack binds.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=4]Set good contrasting mix of outline colors that look proper to your monitor and your eyes, especially if you have any color vision issues.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=4]A Nuncio drone height of 1.2 puts it above a Crusher's head, but it's blinding on a bright screen (OLED+HDR) if scanning VFX is left on. Auto-height in next version.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=4]Set outline settings in the base game esc-&gt;options-interface are and try toggling some for player and companions to \"all companions\", otherwise outlines may turn off when you start a mission.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[*][size=4][b]Tech[/b]: the Nuncio Z override and Shock Mine replacement hook-replace an Update function that runs constantly on every tick, you shouldn't notice any difference (many mods do this for various things) but if you need to test things, disable Replacement and Override via Options checkboxes. Skipping the VFX for those two still works outside of these. [/size]\n<br />[size=4][b]Note[/b]: many mods may hook into or replace function that are constantly called, this shouldn't cause any issues but keep that in mind when troubleshooting.[/size][/list][size=3]\n<br />Please report any issues as I [size=3]otherwise[/size] assume \"no news is good news\".\n<br />[/size]"
