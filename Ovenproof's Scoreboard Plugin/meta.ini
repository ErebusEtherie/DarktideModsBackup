nexusDescription="[b][u][size=4]Notice[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[size=3]Version 1.4, created by Vatinas, will most likely be the last update for this mod. For the last few months I've been working on Power DI, a new stand alone framework for collecting, transforming and displaying Darktide statistical data, which is now finally publicly available on Nexus. Power DI will, at least for me, completely replace this mod for general use. If you are interested please check out [/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/281][size=3]Power DI on Nexus.[/size][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[u]Credits[/u]\n<br />v1.4 by Vatinas\n<br />[size=2]Based on work by Grasmann[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Russian localization by xsSplater\n<br />[/size]Chinese localization by deluxghost\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][u]Description[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />My personal plugin for the Scoreboard mod. Provides detailed overview of stats during and after a game. I was not content with the stats and layout of the available plugins, so I created my own. Has some improvements over the stats tracking of the other currently available Scoreboard plugins.\n<br />\n<br />The mod is designed to be used with the default Scoreboard plugin rows and the scoring system turned off. But do whatever you like :p\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3][u]Notes[/u][/size]\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*][size=2]Please use the latest version of the Scoreboard mod.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Scoreboard is limited on the number of rows it can display before the rows go off screen, please turn off any unneeded rows from the base mod and other plugins.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Currently doesn't track the revives of the veteran shout ability. This is handled server side, so I'm not sure it's possible to track this.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]I think I have most of the damage categorized, but if any damage falls outside of the scope it will print this to chat. Let me know what it says and I can add that attack to one of the categories so it can be tracked.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Will not produce the right damage numbers in private games, other than the meat grinder.[/size]\n<br />[/list][b][u]\n<br />[size=3]Scoreboard sections[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Exploration[/b][size=2][b][/b][/size]\n<br />Tracks the number of material pickups (not amount).[*][b]Defense[/b][size=2][b][/b][/size]\n<br />Tracks the amount of damage taken, health stations used, and the number of times you were disabled or helped people.Also tracks the amount of damage done to teammates, and the number of friendly shots blocked.[*][b]Offense rates[/b][size=2][b][/b][/size]\n<br />Tracks the critical and weakspot rates (if available) of the different categories.
