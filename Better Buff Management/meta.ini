nexusDescription="[size=5]1.9 Update\n<br />[/size]A fix for the \"In window 'Better Buff Management': Missing End()\" is now released.\n<br />In addition to this fix I have a few other things in progress that will be coming in a 2.0 release:\n<br />- Restructuring save data to be bar specific (this will allow you to have the same buff on multiple bars)\n<br />- Add \"reserved\" hidden bar (all buffs added to this bar will be hidden from any custom buff bar)\n<br />- Add alignment and direction support (able to have buffs start on left/right, or go vertical and do up/down)\n<br />- Add search filter to filter out all buffs already in bars\n<br />- Add easy import/export of bars so its easy to share with others\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Fix for 1.7.6 by [url=https://github.com/Wobin]@Wobin[/url] (Thanks)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u]IMPORTANT ABOUT FIX![/u][/size]\n<br />Fat Shark must've renamed some abilities because I could not get old configs to work with this new update. I apologize for the inconvenience but if you are having issues opening the bar config menu please follow the below instructions.\n<br />\n<br />- Open a folder at \"C:&#92;Users&#92;YourUserName&#92;AppData&#92;Roaming&#92;Fatshark&#92;Darktide\"\n<br />- Open \"user_settings.config\" if your preferred text editor\n<br />- Find the \"better_buff_management\" section of the config file (CTRL+F)\n<br />- Delete the \"buffs_data\" section of \"better_buff_management\". You must delete everything from the name to the ending square bracket.\n<br />- Save and you should now be able to launch the game and reconfigure your buff bars\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u]Status of Future Updates![/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />I'm very grateful for all the attention my mod has gotten, this was my first and only mod at the time and so the positive feedback has been great! I don't currently have time to work on updates / wishlist items but I am active on my github and will test any PRs and add contributors if anyone wishes to contribute. Thanks again to [url=https://github.com/Wobin]@Wobin[/url] for getting a fix together for 1.7.6!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />SUPPORTS PATCH 15![/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Create your own custom bars for showing a subset of the buffs in the game. Using the in-game configuration menu provided by this mod you can create your own buff bars with your own names to categorize or sort the in-game buffs as you wish.\n<br />\n<br />Best used with custom hud. Download it from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/10]Nexus[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Installation[/b]\n<br />[/u]This mod uses the Darktide Mod Loader and Darktide Mod Framework.
