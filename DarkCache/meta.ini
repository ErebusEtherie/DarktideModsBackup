nexusDescription="[b][size=4]DarkCache\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[/b]This mod implements prefetching and caching of both the Mourningstar itself, and many of the menus accessible within it such as those of the Armoury, Melk, and the Premium Store. You should find that all the menus load very quickly with this mod. The caching of the Mourningstar level itself is done during the first load, so while your initial load into the Mourningstar won't be any faster, all your subsequent ones should be. [b][UPDATE] [/b]Version 1.3 includes preloading of the Mourningstar, starting as soon as Darktide starts, and should shave some time off loading into the game. Note that this requires that some data be generated [i]during[/i] loading the Mourningstar, so your first load after enabling preloading will not be any faster; subsequent ones will.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WARNING: [/b]The Mourningstar caching will increase memory usage, in particular when you are in a mission, as the assets for the Mourningstar and the mission will be in memory. If this causes you any issues and you want to use the other features of the mod, you can disable the Mourningstar caching in the mod options. Please note though that due to how it works, (currently) you have to restart the game for it to release the Mourningstar assets entirely.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Features\n<br />[/b][list]\n<br />[*]Prefetching and caching for both of the Armoury's stores.\n<br />[*]Prefetching and caching for Melk's Requisitorium including the Contracts menu.\n<br />[*]Prefetching and caching for the Commissary's cosmetics stores.\n<br />\n<br />[*]Prefetching and caching of the Mission Board. This is actually off by default because, honestly, it didn't do much for me personally.\n<br />[*]Prefetching and caching of the Premium Store. No more watching Hallowette wave her arms around for ten seconds.\n<br />[*]Caching of the Mourningstar level itself. For me this reduced my loading time from about 25 seconds to about 10 seconds.\n<br />[*]Much faster Psykhanium loading. For me this was about 3 seconds.\n<br />[*]Mod options for toggling cache items, just in-case you have issues with one of them.\n<br />[*]Preloading of the Mourningstar, saving time loading in. For me the saving is about ten seconds.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[b]Installation\n<br />\n<br />[/b]This mod uses the[b] Darktide Mod Loader[/b] and [b]Darktide Mod Framework[/b] (you'll be prompted to install them when you go to download this mod), which \n<br />are available on this site. Once you have those in place, you can install this mod by extracting the [font=Courier New]DarkCache [/font]folder into your mods folder, then adding [font=Courier New]DarkCache[/font] to your [font=Courier New]mod_load_order.txt[/font].\n<br />\n<br />[b]Usage\n<br />\n<br />[/b]The mod comes with settings for each category of caching so that you can toggle things if something isn't working right. You can access them via the Mod Options menu by hitting Escape, or simply by hitting F4. Mourningstar caching and preloading is disabled by default so that players whose systems have less memory do not immediately run into problems when they add the mod. For everyone else, I recommend enabling both Mourningstar caching and preloading.\n<br />\n<br />If you like my work, please consider supporting me via my [url=https://www.buymeacoffee.com/redbeardt]Buy Me A Coffee[/url]."
