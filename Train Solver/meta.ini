Meant for those that don't find the minigame fun, struggle with hand cramps, or those with a disability.\n<br />\n<br />Works best in solo, efficacy depends on ping/lag (May expereince trouble on especially laggy servers)\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Installation:[/b]\n<br />1. Download the file, it will be zipped. First, extract it.\n<br />2. Inside, there is the TrainSolver folder.\n<br />3. Go to steam, on your game list on the left, right click Darktide -&gt; Manage -&gt; Browse local files.\n<br />4. Go to mods (If there is no mods folder, go to Darktide Modding \n<br />Framework and follow instructions to install the foundation for mods) \n<br />and drop [/size][size=5][font=Times New Roman][size=4]TrainSolver[/size][/font][/size] [size=4]into the mods folder.\n<br />5. In the mods folder, open mod_load_order.txt and add in the line \"[/size][size=5][font=Times New Roman][size=4]TrainSolver[/size][/font][/size][size=4]\" down below.\n<br />6. Make sure toggle_darktide_mods is enabled in the Darktide install folder, too!\n<br />7. Enjoy!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Modding takes a lot of time and effort to do right!

I'm willing to discuss \n<br />requests and see what I can do! Feel free to contact me and ask, it's no\n<br /> bother &lt;3[/size][/font][/size]"
